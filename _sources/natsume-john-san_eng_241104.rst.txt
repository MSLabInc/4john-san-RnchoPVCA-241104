The brushing ball manufacturing
=======================================

{241104}, {241109}

Purpose and Objectives
-----------------------------

   * Attach N brushes around the circumference of the ball.

   * Produce as many as possible in the shortest amount of time.

   * Develop a method (production process) that allows completing the task of attaching brushes around the ball’s circumference in **5 minutes**, or ideally, **3 minutes**.

Approach
-----------------

   * Attach N brushes around the ball’s circumference. To do this, rotate the ball slightly (fixed small angle) each time, and insert and fix a brush each time.

       N steps of rotation (360 degrees / N) will be made with this automatic machine.


   * There are three types of tasks involved in the process of attaching the brushes:
     #. Drill a small hole (into which the brush’s rod will be inserted)
     #. Inject adhesive into the small hole
     #. Set a tow ended brush rod and pressing it into small hole and place using a push rod machine.

   * Develop a process that allows the entire circumference of the ball to be completed **with just one full rotation**.
     This will speed up the installation on each circumference.  
     
     * Switch between the three tasks by rotating the ball in steps of 3 angles.
     * The system will be driven by a stepping motor, but it’s essential to confirm first that the task can be successfully completed manually before automating.

   * If the rotation reaches the final brush installation, **tilt the jig (machine tools of three kinds) backward** after inserting a brush, two open holes are still left(the number N-2) [note]_. Here it is ensuring that the already attached brush axes do not interfere (i.e., the rotation should not stop due to obstruction).

_[note] Two holes are left to do drilling, and adhesive insertion),


### Precautions to order for automating macjine

(Things to consider when ordering a machine)

   (1) Ensure that there is no wobbling or misalignment of the ball and rotation axis, so that when inserting a rod into the ball, it is securely fixed in place.

   (2) The axis must rotate precisely with the stepping motor, completing exactly N steps to complete one full rotation (360 degrees) and return to its starting position.

   (3) Ensure that the positions of the drilled holes are consistently accurate across all N steps of rotation (360 degrees / N), and improve the precision of the rotation axis (suggest using a stepping motor).

   (4) The drilling tool and adhesive insertion must be equipped with a mechanism to tilt the jig backward. However, ensure that the sliding surface is firm and heavy enough to prevent any misalignment when returning to the starting position.
